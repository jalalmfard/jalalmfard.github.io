the artist represents his Iranian identity and connects with the historical concepts of his country. Jalal pushes the limitations to show how he pictures persons and their vibes in his mind without any rules. Jalal Mashhadi Fard uses patterns, forms, and figures as a scenario that he can imagine and enjoy.

His collage artworks are formed in praise of emancipation. With a familiar expression, Jalal tries to invite the audience to break free from the world of reality and law constraints. His work is usually a critique of limitations. It is based on the paradox of elements that, while contradicting each other, achieve peace through his work, thus making the impossible possible with familiar expression.

Jalal believes that all art mediums are interconnected in his artworks to show a more effective presentation of his pleasure. Therefore, he expresses himself to the audience by using different mediums in his artworks in which the viewer is exposed to many signs of architecture, painting, virtual art, etc., in his projects.
